\section*{\underline{Introduction}}

The flower market is a booming industry in Bangladesh now with high profits and diverse opportunities. The increasing use of flowers for not only decorating event halls but also as gifts on special occasions has been the reason for increasing florists in our country but most of them do not have a proper database system to manage their vast workload. The customers who want to buy flowers also have to go through a lot of hassle to find out flower shops and their choice of flowers. These problems might lead to loss of profit. This web application will help business owners to manage and store products and sales data. Customers would be able to book flowers from the comfort of their own homes. Pricing and damage of products, cancellation of orders - all kinds of data will be stored; transactions will be secured. Orders will be taken faster through this website. It will improve the profitability from individual sales and decrease wastage and products. The bouquets will be set to the customers in the best quality and within their specified time.

\section*{\underline{Challenge}}

One of the biggest challenges will be the cost. As there will be a huge amount of data, there could be a chance of high-cost maintenance. The amount of data might also be the reason for the long duration of data processing. The website has to be designed in such a way so that anybody can use it; regardless of their technological expertise. Also, connection and providing security for online payment will be difficult.
